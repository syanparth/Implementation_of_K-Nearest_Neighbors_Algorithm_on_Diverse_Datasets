# Implementation of K-Nearest Neighbors Algorithm on Diverse Datasets

This repository demonstrates the implementation of the K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) algorithm on two different datasets: the Iris dataset and a BMI classification dataset. It includes both the use of the `scikit-learn` library and a custom implementation of the KNN algorithm from scratch.

## Introduction

The K-Nearest Neighbors algorithm is a simple, yet effective, supervised learning algorithm used for classification and regression. This project showcases its application on two datasets using both a popular machine learning library, `scikit-learn`, and a custom implementation to understand its mechanics better.
